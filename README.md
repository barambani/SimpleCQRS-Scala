# SimpleCQRS-Scala

SimpleCQRS-Scala is an exercise inspired by [Greg Young's SimpleCQRS](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) and [Tuomas Hietanen's SimpleCQRS FSharp](https://github.com/Thorium/SimpleCQRS-FSharp). As those projects, it's an attempt to explore the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html" target="_blank">Command Query Responsibility Segregation</a> pattern with a functional programming approach in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).
